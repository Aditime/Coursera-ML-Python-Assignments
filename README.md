# Coursera Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng

## Programming Assignments in Python 

This repository has the Python programming assignments I did as part of the [Machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) in Coursera taught by Andrew Ng. The course is considered the best introductory machine learning course in MOOC world. It goes through machine learning basics in details and quized and programming assignments. It was a good learning experience for me. 

One aspect of the course is that the programming assignments are in MATLAB or OCTAVE. I wanted to practice the programming assignments in Python, as most real world machine learning projects use python.  

I came across a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments) by Gerges Dib. The repository has all the assignments in python. He included explanations and formulas from the original courses and added the exercises. I was amazed when I realized that I could submit the exercises from the notebook and get my grades. 

The course by Andrew Ng and python version of the assignments are extremely helpful to start my journey in Machine Learning arena. 

Please check out my programming solution in this repository.
