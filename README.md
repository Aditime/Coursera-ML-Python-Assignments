# Coursera Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng

## Programming Assignments in Python 

This repository has the assignment I did as part of the Machine learning course in Coursera taught by Andrew Ng. The Machine learning course is considered the best introductory machine learning course in the MOOC world. The course goes through machine learning basics in details. It was a good learning experience for me. 
One aspect of the course is that the programming assignments are in MATLAB or OCTAVE. I wanted to practice the programming assignments in Python, as most machine learning projects in real world are done by the programming language. 

I came across a GitHub repository by Gerges Dib. The repository has all the assignments in python. He included explanations and formulas from the original courses and added the exercises. I was amazed when I realized that I could submit the exercises from the notebook and get my grades. 

The course by Andrew Ng and python version of the assignments are extremely helpful to start my journey in Machine Learning arena. 

Please check out my programming solution in this repository.
